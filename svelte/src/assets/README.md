# Got a question to contribute?
In the spirit of reflection and collaborative experimentation, [conversations.dora.dev](https://conversations.dora.dev) presents a set of provocative questions that anyone can ask of themselves, or use to kick off a discussion in their team. The idea is inspired by things like [conversation openers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_opener) and [oblique strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies).

#### Here are a few examples:
* What would happen if you turned off all your automated tests?
* How do you know if a feature is valuable to your users?
* Who is most likely to slow down or block a release? What's their motivation?

**What ideas do you have?** Get creative! The only requirement is that your question is open-ended, to provoke a conversation.
